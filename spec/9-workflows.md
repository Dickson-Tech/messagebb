# 9 Internal Workflows

A workflow provides a detailed view of how this Building Block will interact with other Building Blocks to support common use cases.

This section lists workflows that this Building Block must support. Other workflows may be implemented in addition to those listed.

## 9.1    Standards

&#x20;**** The workflows MUST adhere to all standards defined in this document as well as in the GovStack architecture document (link to appropriate section in architecture document)

### 9.2.1 Prerequisites and dependencies <a href="#_3j2qqm3" id="_3j2qqm3"></a>

The main prerequisite for "Person-to-Building Block **** communication" is that there is an existing Sender/Source Building Block with the following properties:

* the relevant credentials and details about the Person/Citizen to be addressed with;
* the content of the message and a reference to a communication channel (contact details) to be used;
* additionally, the service discovery service at the Information Mediator Building Block needs to be active. Information Mediator Building Block publishes the list of available services of the Messaging Building Block to the source GovStack Building Block, i.e. Workflow.

A reference token should be carried throughout the communication session in order to save a point of reference for reverse communication back from the Person to the Building Block. In other words, the main prerequisite for Person-to-Building Block communication is the availability of a communication channel and a reference token.

#### **9.2.1.1      Description**

This generic workflow is used to transfer messages between GovStack Building Block and the end user, Person. Data is submitted from a GovStack Building Block front-end application. This workflow shows a connection to GovStack Building Block (such as a government Health System Application) to convey a message that is associated with a real person.

#### **9.2.1.2      Interaction with Other Building Blocks**

This workflow requires interaction with the Information Mediator Building Block and a source GovStack Building Block, for example, a Health Care Service Building Block or registry Building Block.

#### **9.2.1.3      Sequence Diagram**

The sequence diagram shows the flow of data between Building Blocks for this workflow.
