# 8 Service APIs

This section provides a reference for APIs that should be implemented by this Building Block. The APIs defined here establish a blueprint for how the Building Block will interact with other Building Blocks. Additional APIs may be implemented by the Building Block, but the listed APIs define a minimal set of functionality that should be provided by any implementation of this Building Block.

Messaging Building Blocks's APIs can be found from [https://github.com/GovStackWorkingGroup/bb-messaging/tree/main/api](https://github.com/GovStackWorkingGroup/bb-messaging/tree/main/api).

The [GovStack non-functional requirements document](https://govstack.gitbook.io/specification/architecture-and-nonfunctional-requirements/6-onboarding) provides additional information on how 'adaptors' may be used to translate an existing API to the patterns described.
