# 4 Key Digital Functionalities

The Messaging Building Block is a standalone messaging gateway/client/proxy (including all possible modalities: email, SMS, etc.) but can also facilitate connections with existing messaging service providers by enabling safe communication. The communication in this Building Block can be categorized in two different directions as follows:

## 4.1 Government to person (G2P) <a href="#docs-internal-guid-c38a9447-7fff-fcb5-e6eb-c6419072f004" id="docs-internal-guid-c38a9447-7fff-fcb5-e6eb-c6419072f004"></a>

> In scope of v1

* informing End clients about their registration;
* reminding and requesting End clients' confirmation for appointment booking or other events;
* getting confirmation about government services and interactions.

> In scope of future releases

* delivering information at scale to End clients;
* alerting End clients in emergency contexts.
