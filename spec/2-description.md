# 2 Description

Utilizing a secure communication protocol, the Messaging Building Block establishes a communication channel between GovStack services and end customers, and citizens, in a GovStack implementation.

* For green-fields development, it helps developers to build communication components on top of different GovStack services to make use of the federated architecture and passing messages, including machine and human-triggered (both synchronous and asynchronous) messages.
* Messaging Building Block is a standalone messaging gateway/client/proxy (including all possible modalities: email, SMS etc.), but can also facilitate connections with existing messaging service providers, hence it is making **** the adoption process less disruptive for end users.

This BB can be used for messaging events in many different applications and use cases such as:

* Example A, encrypted: after being enrolled into a Health Care Program for the mothers of a newborn child, a woman/caretaker receives a message from the Health Care Service Provider about a doctor's appointment. The message is routed to an existing communication channel/application, in use and provided by the mother.
* Example B, unencrypted: a reminder/notification message from the service provider to the mother about the same appointment. If a doctor decides to hold the consultation remotely, a link is sent to the mother and a video consultation is started (conference is started and users join the room). The event is triggered by the Scheduler Building Block component and a new message is processed to the client.
* Example C: a user-initiated message about a doctor consultation, targeted to a Health Care Provider's phone number or a chatbot URL (universal or targeted messaging back to the system).
